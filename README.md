# xow-install-script
The purpose of the script is to automate the installation of the Xbox One wireless dongle driver ([xow](https://github.com/medusalix/xow)).
The installation instructions on the xow page are fairly straight-forward, but I've personally ran into issues with ensuring that the 
prerequisites are installed, so that will likely be this script's main usefulness.

Please see the xow page for full details about the wireless dongle driver and the important notes, the main thing being:
***By using xow, you accept Microsoft's license terms for their driver package.***
